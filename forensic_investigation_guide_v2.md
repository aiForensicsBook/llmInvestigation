# Forensic Investigation Guide for Resume Screening LLM - Enhanced Version

## Purpose

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for conducting comprehensive forensic investigations of AI bias in resume screening systems. It is designed for forensic investigators, legal professionals, and compliance auditors. This enhanced version includes detailed explanations of each step, expected outputs, and visualization guidance.

## 🔍 Investigation Methodology

### Phase 1: Evidence Collection

#### 1.1 Initial Assessment
```bash
# Document the system environment
python forensic/collection/metadata_extractor.py --system-info > investigation/system_snapshot.json

# Create investigation case
export CASE_ID="INV_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
export INVESTIGATOR="Your Name"
export ORGANIZATION="Investigation Firm"
```

**Purpose**: This step establishes a baseline snapshot of the system environment and creates a unique case identifier for tracking all investigation activities. The metadata extraction captures critical system information including hardware specifications, software versions, and environmental variables that may influence model behavior.

**Expected Output**: The system_snapshot.json file contains:
- System architecture details
- Python version and installed packages
- Hardware specifications (CPU, memory, storage)
- Environment variables
- Timestamp of collection
- Digital signatures for integrity verification

**Why This Step**: Legal proceedings require establishing the technical context in which the alleged discrimination occurred. This baseline documentation proves the system state at the time of investigation and ensures reproducibility of findings.

#### 1.2 Model Artifact Collection
```bash
# Collect model files with full metadata
python forensic/collection/forensic_collector.py \
    --source models/ \
    --destination evidence/${CASE_ID}/model_artifacts \
    --case-id ${CASE_ID} \
    --investigator "${INVESTIGATOR}"

# Collect training data
python forensic/collection/forensic_collector.py \
    --source data/ \
    --destination evidence/${CASE_ID}/training_data \
    --case-id ${CASE_ID} \
    --investigator "${INVESTIGATOR}"
```

**Purpose**: This step secures all model artifacts and training data with cryptographic integrity verification. The forensic collector creates a tamper-evident chain of custody that documents when, how, and by whom evidence was collected.

**Expected Output**: 
- Model files (.pkl, .joblib, .h5) with SHA-256 hashes
- Training datasets with integrity checksums
- Metadata files documenting collection process
- Chain of custody records with timestamps
- Evidence manifest listing all collected items

**What the Script Does**: The forensic collector performs:
1. Recursive directory scanning for model files
2. Cryptographic hashing of all files (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512)
3. Metadata extraction (file size, creation date, modification date)
4. Digital signature generation for integrity verification
5. Evidence packaging with tamper-evident seals

**Why This Step**: Model artifacts contain the "DNA" of the AI system. Any bias present in the model weights, training data, or configuration files represents potential evidence of discrimination. Proper chain of custody ensures this evidence is admissible in legal proceedings.

***INSERT SCREENSHOT: Directory structure showing collected model artifacts with hash values and metadata***

#### 1.3 System Log Collection
```bash
# Collect application logs

    --investigator "${INVESTIGATOR}"

# Validate evidence integrity
python forensic/collection/evidence_validator.py \
    --evidence-dir evidence/${CASE_ID} \
    --generate-report
```

**Purpose**: System logs capture the operational history of the AI system, including decision patterns, error conditions, and administrative actions. Log analysis can reveal discriminatory patterns not visible in the model itself.

**Expected Output**:
- Application logs with parsing metadata
- System logs with timeline reconstruction
- Error logs showing system failures
- Audit logs documenting administrative actions
- Evidence integrity report with validation results

**What the Script Does**: The evidence validator performs:
1. Hash verification of all collected evidence
2. Timestamp consistency checking
3. Digital signature validation
4. Chain of custody verification
5. Evidence completeness assessment
6. Integrity report generation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Model Loading Errors
```bash
# Check model file integrity
python forensic/collection/evidence_validator.py --verify-model models/resume_llm_latest.pkl

# Regenerate model if corrupted
python src/train.py --output models/resume_llm_backup.pkl
```

**Purpose**: Model loading errors can prevent analysis and compromise investigation integrity. This troubleshooting process verifies model file integrity and provides recovery options.

**What These Commands Do**:
- First command: Validates model file integrity using cryptographic hashes
- Second command: Regenerates model from training data if corruption is detected

**Expected Output**:
- Integrity verification report with pass/fail status
- Detailed error messages if corruption is detected
- New model file with verified integrity if regeneration is needed

**Why This Matters**: Corrupted models can produce invalid analysis results and compromise investigation findings. Integrity verification ensures reliable results.

#### Data Format Issues
```bash
# Validate data format
python forensic/testing/validate_data_format.py --data-dir data/synthetic/

# Convert data if needed
python forensic/utils/convert_data_format.py --input data/raw/ --output data/processed/
```

**Purpose**: Data format issues can prevent proper analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions. This troubleshooting process validates data format and provides conversion utilities.

**What These Commands Do**:
- First command: Validates data format against expected schema
- Second command: Converts data to proper format for analysis

**Expected Output**:
- Data validation report with format compliance status
- Conversion log showing successful data transformation
- Properly formatted data files ready for analysis

**Why This Matters**: Incorrect data formats can cause analysis failures and produce unreliable results. Format validation ensures data integrity.

#### Dashboard Access Issues
```bash
# Reset dashboard authentication
cd forensic/dashboards && python reset_auth.py

# Check dashboard configuration
python forensic/dashboards/validate_config.py
```

**Purpose**: Dashboard access issues can prevent investigation progress and limit stakeholder access to findings. This troubleshooting process resolves authentication and configuration problems.

**What These Commands Do**:
- First command: Resets authentication credentials and access controls
- Second command: Validates dashboard configuration settings

**Expected Output**:
- Authentication reset confirmation with new credentials
- Configuration validation report with status and recommendations
- Dashboard accessibility verification

**Why This Matters**: Dashboard access is essential for investigation progress and stakeholder communication. Proper authentication ensures secure access to sensitive findings.

#### Performance Issues
```bash
# Monitor system resources
python forensic/utils/system_monitor.py --duration 300

# Optimize analysis parameters
python forensic/testing/optimize_analysis.py --reduce-samples --parallel-threads 4
```

**Purpose**: Performance issues can slow investigation progress and consume excessive resources. This troubleshooting process monitors system performance and optimizes analysis parameters.

**What These Commands Do**:
- First command: Monitors system resources (CPU, memory, disk) for 5 minutes
- Second command: Optimizes analysis parameters for better performance

**Expected Output**:
- System resource usage report with performance metrics
- Optimization recommendations for improved performance
- Adjusted analysis parameters for efficient processing

**Why This Matters**: Poor performance can delay investigation completion and impact resource availability. Performance optimization ensures efficient investigation progress.
